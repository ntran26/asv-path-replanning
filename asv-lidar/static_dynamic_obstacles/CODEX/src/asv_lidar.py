"""Simulated RPLidar C1: 360 deg raycast against obstacle polygons.

Carried over from Paper 2 with **one substantive change**: this sensor sees
obstacles only.  The `map_border` argument and every border-visibility mode are
gone.  Channel boundaries reach the policy through `boundary_raycast.py`
instead, computed from the map rather than the sensor (01 §3, decision D5).

The raycast maths itself is unchanged from Paper 2's vectorised implementation.

Two sensor properties are modelled here that Paper 2 did not have:

* **360 deg / 720 beams at 0.5 deg.**  Paper 2 simulated 225 beams over 270 deg
  (1.205 deg).  The full sweep is required so the tracker can see overtaking
  vessels approaching from astern (Rule 13); the pooled `c_t` still uses only
  the forward +/-135 deg.
* **A 1 m minimum range.**  The C1 returns nothing closer than 1 m -- confirmed
  across all 30 field logs, where the smallest non-zero value is 10 dm.  Paper 2
  reported ranges down to 0.  Modelling it matters: with the sensor at the bow
  of a 1.57 m hull, a target alongside inside 1 m is invisible to the real
  sensor, and a policy trained without the dead zone would rely on returns that
  never arrive.  Collision termination stays geometric and is unaffected.
* **An aft self-occlusion mask.**  A 360 deg scanner on a hull with
  superstructure has a blind or degraded arc astern.  It is not detectable in
  the existing logs (see `constants.py` §4), so the mask half-width is 0.0 until
  a static-spin recording settles it -- but the hook is on the path, because
  this arc gates the **being-overtaken** class.  Train the tracker to see astern
  when the real mount cannot, and Rule 17 behaviour fails in the field for
  reasons that have nothing to do with the policy.
* **Per-beam dropout.**  A Study 2 axis and a stand-in for the no-return process
  the field logs show.  Nominal 0.0.
